This investigation is about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. In this case we are going to investigate the following indicators: BMI,GDP per capita, GNI per capita, life expectancy, health expendeture per GDP and Choresterol in blood for the following countries:

United States , Canada, France, Spain, Australia,Mozambique, Mali, Madagascar, Malawi and Rwanda

The question we are going to adress are the following:

In general, Is there any trend in this indicators?
Is there any difference by gender in choresterol and BMI contents?
Is there any realtion between Health Expendeture and Life Expectancy?

In the notebook you can see some conclusions that have been drawn in this EDA
